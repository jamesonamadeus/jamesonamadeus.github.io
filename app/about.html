                    <p>Howdy there!</p>
                    <p>Thank you for coming through my neck of the woods üå≤ of the interweb üåê.</p>
                    <p>My trade skills are and not limited to front-end development, ux/ui design, and business strategy. Founded 2 startups: 1 bookmarked (my nice way of saying failure - will revive it with the right team) with many lessons learned and the other striving to make an impact in the recruiting industry. Currently, matchmaking employees and employers for a sustainable professional relationship for the ever-growing remote ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>I am a user enthusiast, who is passionate in bringing ideas to life through code. Getting out of the boardroom with the assumptions, and going where the users are to ask their pain points. Empathy has always been and always will be an important aspect in my life. From working in diverse roles throughout my career (26 roles and counting! e.g. physiologist, construction worker, and even a dishwasher), I‚Äôve gained immense amount of life experiences in understanding various user personas.</p>
                    <p>I have a diploma degree in Physiology and Bioethics that is collecting dust. Originally on the path of dental school, diverted to a more heart fulfilling life in startups and innovation. I am a firm believer that education is the solution to many of our problems that exist in our society.</p>
                    <p>Passions: Dancing to the break of dawn, Music/Film Festivals, Hackathons, Mentorship, Cooking Ribs, Rubik's Cubes, Smiling</p>
                    <p>I like to think myself as a novice at heart in the work that I do, because if I was a master, I would have nothing else to learn. Striving to learn all day, everyday. If you ever want to discuss about a problem that will lead to spinning up a mini startup for fun, give me a shout.</p>
                    <p>- Jimi</p>
