                <p>Howdy there!</p>
                <p>My name is Jimi and thank you for coming through my neck of the woods üå≤ of the interweb üåê!</p>
                <p>This is the part where I tell you what my "one" role is, but I do not consider myself just a developer or
                    designer, but I do enjoy connecting with people. So... let's go with user enthusiast, who is passionate
                    in bringing ideas to life through code. Trade skills of mine are and not limited to front-end development,
                    ux/ui design, business strategy, and recruiting. I've advised early stage startups and mentored for a
                    non-profit, all while connecting the dots with clients at a design firm. Founded 2 startups: 1 bookmarked
                    (my nice way of saying failure - planning to revive it for the road ahead) with many lessons learned,
                    and the other striving to make an impact in the recruiting industry. Currently, matchmaking employees
                    and employers for a sustainable professional relationship for the ever-growing remote ecosystem.</p>
                <p>My approach to a problem is by first getting out of the boardroom (without a pre-solution loaded with assumptions),
                    and go where the users are to ask them their pain points. Empathy has always been and will be an integral
                    component in my process. From working in diverse roles throughout my career (22 roles and counting! e.g.
                    physiologist, hotel night audit, bartender, and even a dishwasher), I‚Äôve gained immense amount of life
                    experiences in understanding various user personas. Not to mention, I learned that hard-work &amp; grit
                    > intelligence, any time of the day.</p>
                <p>I am a firm believer that education technology is the solution to many of our problems that exist in our
                    society. Rather than providing the answers to ones who are in need, we should be extending our resources
                    so that they can rise up on a solution of their own. By open-sourcing our knowledge, we can achieve so
                    much more in life, together. Some of my side passions are and not limited to the following: dancing to
                    the break of dawn, music/film festivals, hackathons, mentorship, burritos, rubik's cubes, smiling (if
                    you can't tell).</p>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a novice at heart in the work that I do, because if I was a master, I would
                    have nothing else to learn. Striving to learn all day, everyday. If you ever want to discuss about a
                    problem that will lead to spinning up a mini startup for fun, feel free to give me a shout
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesonamadeus">@jamesonamadeus</a>.</p>
                <p>Thanks again for swinging by.</p>
                <p>- Jimi</p>
